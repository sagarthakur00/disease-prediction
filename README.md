Decision Prediction Model
Overview
The Decision Prediction Model is designed to predict outcomes or decisions based on historical data and predefined decision criteria. The model uses machine learning techniques to analyze input features and predict the most probable decision or outcome.

Features
Predicts outcomes: The model predicts the decision or classification based on input features.

Historical data analysis: The model trains on historical datasets to learn patterns and relationships.

Supports various algorithms: The model can be built using different algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.

Easy integration: Can be integrated into any decision-making system or web service.

Requirements
Python 3.x

Libraries:

pandas

numpy

scikit-learn

matplotlib (for visualization)

seaborn (optional, for enhanced visualization)

xgboost (if using XGBoost model)

To install the dependencies, run:

nginx
Copy
pip install -r requirements.txt
Installation
Clone this repository:

bash
Copy
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/decision-prediction-model.git
cd decision-prediction-model
Install the required dependencies:

nginx
Copy
pip install -r requirements.txt
Data
The model requires a dataset in a tabular format (CSV, Excel, etc.) with the following fields:

Feature 1: Description of feature 1

Feature 2: Description of feature 2

Feature 3: Description of feature 3

Label/Target: The decision or outcome that the model will predict.

Ensure the dataset is cleaned and preprocessed before training the model. Missing values and outliers should be handled appropriately.

Usage
Training the Model
To train the model, use the following script:

css
Copy
python train_model.py --data path_to_data.csv --model_type random_forest
path_to_data.csv: Path to the dataset file.

--model_type: Specifies the type of machine learning algorithm to use. Options: logistic_regression, random_forest, xgboost.

Making Predictions
To make predictions on new data:

css
Copy
python predict.py --model path_to_trained_model.pkl --input path_to_input_data.csv
path_to_trained_model.pkl: Path to the trained model file.

path_to_input_data.csv: Path to the input data file for predictions.

Evaluate Model
To evaluate the model's performance, run:

css
Copy
python evaluate_model.py --model path_to_trained_model.pkl --test_data path_to_test_data.csv
This will output the model's accuracy, confusion matrix, classification report, etc.

Example
Sample input data (input.csv):

Feature 1	Feature 2	Feature 3
1.5	3.0	0.7
2.3	1.8	2.5
Sample output (prediction):

vbnet
Copy
Predicted Decision: Class 1
Model Evaluation
To evaluate the performance of the decision prediction model, the following metrics are commonly used:

Accuracy: Proportion of correct predictions.

Precision: Ability of the model to not classify negative samples as positive.

Recall: Ability of the model to capture all positive samples.

F1-score: Harmonic mean of precision and recall.
